Welcome to my blog Kanoki. It's a blog about cool tech stuffs mostly related to Python, Automation, Data Science, Statistics and Maths. I write Tech in a simple & sober way for anyone to understand. Remember the famous quote from Albert Einstein:

        	If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

The articles posted on this blog are primarily for beginners and focus on basics because I believe basics are the building blocks for anything in life and if you master the basics then learning advance things is a cake walk.

# Maths!!

I love everything about Maths and hungry for everything related to it. I don't like to learn any stuffs unless I understand the Maths underneath. Well someone said this whole universe is built on Maths and it's everywhere. 

Some cool stuffs about Maths: 

- Divide the distance between earth and Sun by Diameter of Sun and that gives ~108

- Divide the distance between earth and Moon by Diameter of Moon and that gives ~108

- Moon takes approximately 28 days to rotate around earth and it controls the earth axis which is tilted at 23.5 degrees.

Now read those numbers 108, 28 and 23.5 and see if it is related to anything in your life? Yes, find it out.
