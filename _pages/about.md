Welcome to my blog Kanoki. It's a blog about cool tech stuffs mostly related to Python, Automation, Data Science, Statistics and Maths. I write Tech in a simple & sober way for anyone to understand. Remember the famous quote from Albert Einstein:

```reStructuredText
    	If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
```

The articles posted on this blog are primarily for beginners and focus on basics because I believe basics are the building blocks for anything in life and if you master the basics then learning advance things is a cake walk.

# Maths!!

I love everything about Maths and hungry for everything related to it. I don't like to learn any stuffs unless I understand the Maths underneath. Well someone said this whole universe is built on Maths and it's everywhere. 

Some cool stuffs about Maths: 

- Divide the distance between earth and Sun by Diameter of Sun and that gives ~108

- Divide the distance between earth and Moon by Diameter of Moon and that gives ~108

- Moon makes complete orbit around the earth in 28 days and it controls the earth axis which is tilted at 23.5 degrees.

Now read those numbers 108, 28*10=280 and 23.5 and see if it is related to anything in your life? Yes it is, find it out.
