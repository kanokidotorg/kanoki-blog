As a Data Scientist, One of the major challenge is to hunt for the dataset sources and normal web search engines doesn't help much here. So to overcome this problem google has launched it's own [Dataset search engine](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) which is in Beta now but can help to look for the millions of data sources all over the web.

At a very high level, this dataset search engine relies on the dataset providers metadata information which provides all the salient information about their dataset like name, description, spatial, coverage etc. and build index of this corpus of metadata which then retrieved based on the user Query.

Overall it's a great tool by Google which can really help the data scientist community to look for the dataset instead of searching for it on a web search engine.
